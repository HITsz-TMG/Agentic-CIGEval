Two images will be provided: The first being a processed image (e.g. Canny edges, openpose, grayscale etc.) and the second being an AI-generated image using the first image as guidance.
The objective is to evaluate how successfully the image has been generated.

From scale 0 to 10:

(0 indicates that the second image does not follow the prompt at all. 10 indicates the second image follows the prompt perfectly.)
A second score from 0 to 10 will rate how well the generated image is following the guidance image. 
(0 indicates that the second image is not following the guidance at all. 10 indicates that second image is following the guidance image.)
Put the score in a list such that output score = [score1, score2], where 'score1' evaluates the prompt and 'score2' evaluates the guidance.

Special case:
Put score = [0,0] if the second is blank or completely black.

You will have to give your output in this way (Keep your reasoning concise and short.):
